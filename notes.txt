TIME COMPLEXITY:-
Computers are very fast, and the difference between performing 10 iterations
in a loop and 1,000 iterations may seem immaterial to us. However, algorithms
can quickly become inefficient as the problem grows. In measuring complexity, 
we are interested in how the time that is taken to execute the algorithm
changes as the size of the problem changes. If the problem is 10 times as large,
does the algorithm take 10 times as long to execute, 100 times as long, or 1010
times as long? This relationship between the size of the problem and the steps 
taken is called the time complexity of an algorithm
